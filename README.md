CENG327 Group 19
Audio Analysis Project
This project performs comprehensive audio analysis including time domain visualization, frequency spectrum analysis, and perceptual analysis using A-weighting filters.
Features

Time Domain Visualization of audio waveforms
RMS and Decibel (dB) calculation
Frequency Spectrum Analysis using FFT
A-Weighting Filter implementation for perceptual analysis
Detailed visualization of frequency spectrums

Requirements

Python 3.x
librosa
numpy
matplotlib
scipy

Installation
pip install librosa numpy matplotlib scipy
Usage

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/FatmaNurKucukkeskin/Ceng327_Project.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd Ceng327_Project
Place your audio file (in .wav format) in the project directory
Run the analysis script:
python Ceng327_project.py

Project Structure

Ceng327_project.py: Main script containing the audio analysis code
data/: Directory containing sample audio files
Sample audio files have been uploaded to the repository for testing purposes

Output
The script will generate:

Waveform visualization
Frequency spectrum plot
A-weighted frequency spectrum plot
Various audio metrics including RMS, dB levels, and A-weighting values
